# Ollama Models (DO NOT UPLOAD!)
# Ollama models are usually stored in the user's home directory under .ollama
# They are downloaded locally, not part of the source code.
# We explicitly note this here to avoid confusion.
# The app code (app.py) downloads models dynamically.
.ollama # If you happen to have a local .ollama folder in your project, ignore it.
